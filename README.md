## Maria Dominguez Alvarenga - Data Analytics Portfolio

I recently finished my MSc in Data Analytics, and I also have a BA in Business.  I am confident that my strong analytical, problem-solving skills, intellectual curiosity, ability to convey complex information clearly would make me a valuable addition to any organization. 

During the Master, I did apply research for any different project, Exploratory Data Analysis, and then the application of deep and machine learning models for real-world intricate datasets. I did also gather knowledge in Big data distributed platforms, including Apache Hadoop, Spark and NoSQL databases.

In my free time, I do enjoy looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills through online courses for Data Analytics also reading about Data Science related topics.

This is a repository to showcase my skills, share some of the projects I prepared during the MSc in Data Analytics which were based in solving problems for various domains such as Construction, Electricity Consumption, Fraud Detection and others.
